# Mechanical Onboarding

Welcome to MIL - we're excited to hear that you'd like to join the mechanical team!
The mechanical team is responsible for the design and construction of several
components of the robots. As a mechanical member, you will be engaging with CAD
files mostly.

more general overview of MIL, please check that page first!

## Join the mechanical channel
Like the other teams, we use Slack as our primary communication platform. Our
Slack workspace can be found at [https://uf-mil.slack.com](https://uf-mil.slack.com/).
Ask someone in MIL to invite you or email [andrespulido@ufl.edu](mailto:andrespulido@ufl.edu).

Once youâ€™re on Slack, be sure to join the [#mechanical](https://uf-mil.slack.com/messages/C6UQUU78Q)
channel. This is where we will post important updates about the mechanical team,
including meeting times.

## Join our Github
We keep track of our tasks through GitHub issues. In order to contribute to tasks,
you need to create an account in **GitHub** and then email [andrespulido@ufl.edu](mailto:andrespulido@ufl.edu)
for access to the MIL GitHub organization. Alternatively, you can ask a MIL leader
you know to add you to the organization.

You can find the list of issues [here](https://github.com/uf-mil/mil/issues).
You will notice that there are other issues for the software and electrical teams,
which isn't super helpful for you (unless you want to help out those teams as well!).
To filter for just Mechanical tasks, click the `Label` dropdown, and choose the
`mechanical` label.

When you are first getting started, you may also want to find a task that is good
for new members. To do this, also select for the `good first issue` using the `Label`
dropdown, like you did to choose the `mechanical` label.

When you find a task, make sure to make yourself assigned to it. You can do this
in the GitHub UI: click on a task, and on the righthand sidebar, click `Assignees`
and find your username. This will let the other mechanical members and leaders know
that you are working on that task.

## Join our GrabCAD
You should also ask a leader about joining the mechanical GrabCAD, which is where
we store all of our CAD files.

## Start to get familiar with our technical projects
Below are some of our current projects:
* Subjugator 8
* Subjugator 9 (WIP)
* NaviGator
* [Drone](/docs/navigator/drone.md)
