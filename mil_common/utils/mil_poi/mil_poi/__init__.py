"""
The MIL POI system is used to keep track of relevant points of interest across
a landscape. This can be used to give a robotic system a headstart in determining
the final target of a mission; for example, a robotic system could be instructed
to head to a specific POI before looking around more closely to find the actual object
it needs to interact with.
