Culture
=======

The Machine Intelligence Lab has a unique student culture which creates a synergistic environment dedicated to the study and development of intelligent, autonomous robots. Without an application process, new members are encouraged to show up in MIL. We believe that learning occurs best by being inquisitive, and therefore we continually encourage all members to ask fellow MILers about their ongoing projects and tasks in order to learn about Subjugator and Navigator.
