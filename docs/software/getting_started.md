# Getting Started

This page describes the recommended process of setting up a new Ubuntu system
to work with the MIL repository and its dependencies. Ubuntu is an operating system
(similar to OS X or Windows) that MIL (and other robotics labs) choose to use
because of its familiarity with ROS.

## System Requirements

Autonomous robotics is computationally expensive, especially when running simulations.
Your VM or computer should have at least 4GB, although it will run much faster with
8GB of RAM or higher. You should have at least a dual-core system, but using
more cores will allow compilation to run much faster.

If you are using a virtual machine, you can change the amount of RAM and the
number of CPU cores allotted to the virtual machine by visiting the settings
of your VM software.

## Installing Ubuntu

To use Ubuntu in MIL, you have two options:

1. Use a **virtual machine**. A virtual machine uses your current operating system
to virtually host another operating system (in this case, Ubuntu). This will
likely cause your Ubuntu system to run slow (in some cases, it might be unusable)
and may cause you to experience issues with certain programs.

2. **Dual-boot your computer.** Dual booting will allocate a piece of your computer's
storage to a new operating system, which will be installed on your computer directly.
This dual-booted solution will not run on top of your current operating system, but
will instead run by directly using your computer's resources.

Dual-booting your computer is highly recommended over using a virtual machine,
as it allows your Ubuntu setup to tap directly into your computer's resources.
However, it's totally your choice.

:::{warning}
If you **have an M-series (ARM) Mac computer**, you will need to use a
virtual machine as these systems are not able to have two operating systems installed
at once. Intel-based Macs may also experience some issues with dual-booting Ubuntu.
:::

Please follow the link that suits your best use case:

* **Dual-booting a Windows computer**: Dual-booting on windows is the best option
to install Ubuntu on a Windows computer. To complete the process, [look here](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot).

* **Using a virtual machine on Windows:** You could also use a virtual machine
software on Windows to run Ubuntu. These software include VirtualBox or VMWare.
Choose which virtualization software works best for you and find a tutorial on how
to install Ubuntu.

* **Using Parallels on MacOS**: Parallels is a favorited virtual machine software
available on MacOS. It is not free, although there is a student discount available.
To see how to install Ubuntu on MacOS with parallels, see
[here](https://peterwitham.com/videos/how-to-install-ubuntu-20-04-lts-on-parallels-for-mac/).

* **Using UTM on a Mac**: UTM is a virtual machine software that is compatible with
MacOS. The software is free, unlike Parallels, but requires more setup by the user.
For instructions on installing Ubuntu with UTM,
[see here](https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/ubuntu-20-04).

After you have the operating system downloaded, you may need to configure it.
This includes setting your preferred language and keyboard layout, along with
your username and password. Set these settings up to your liking, but note that
having a shorter username may save you some typing in the long run.

## Updating packages

First, we will refresh the list of packages available for your computer. You
will install packages on Ubuntu using the `apt` package manager. You may also
see this written as `apt-get`; the two commands are very similar and usually
achieve the same purpose.

(To access the Terminal on Ubuntu, click the 9 dots in the bottom left corner
and find the Terminal app. You can later install a different terminal emulator,
if you'd like.)

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt upgrade
```

:::{note}
The `$` shown before the commands above indicates that those commands are meant
to be run in your computer's shell. Do not type these dollar signs; only type
what comes after them.

You may also see `>>>` in code examples on pages you visit later. This indicates
that those code examples are meant to be run in the Python REPL. Furthermore,
`...` is used to represent a Python command that is meant to be indented before
it's ran in the REPL.

## Install git

To contribute changes, you will need to have [git](https://www.git-scm.com) installed.
This program will be used to track and upload any changes that you make to the repository.

```bash
$ sudo apt install git
```

## Cloning the repository

You need to clone (download) a copy of the repository onto your computer so you
can make changes.

First clone the upstream (MIL's fork) version of the repo. It is recommended
that you first create a catkin workspace and clone it into the `src` or that
workspace.

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src && cd ~/catkin_ws/src
```

Then, clone the repository (the `--recurse-submodules` is essential, as that is
what pulls the submodules, `-j8` is a speed optimization that downloads up to 8
submodules at a time). Cloning the repository allows you to have a local copy
of the code on your computer.

```bash
$ git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/uf-mil/mil.git
```

Navigate to the root of the repository now. If you have followed the
instructions exactly, you can get there through:

```bash
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/mil
```

## Run the setup scripts

If you are running Ubuntu, and prefer to run code directly on your "host"
operating system without using Docker, you can run the following scripts from
the root of the repository.

If you're wondering what these scripts do, they install all of the tools needed
for you to work in MIL (``git``, ROS, Python dependencies, etc.). Feel free
to open up the file in an editor if you're more curious.

```bash
$ ./scripts/install.sh
$ exec bash # or exec zsh if you have set up zsh
```

Exit the terminal and enter it again.

To build our tools, we use a tool that ROS provides us named `catkin_make`. This
searches through all of our packages and compiles them together. You can use an
alias, `cm` to call `catkin_make` quickly, from wherever you are in the MIL directory.

```bash
$ cm
```

If something goes wrong, try the suggestions in [Getting Help](help). It's common
for the build to fail if your system was unable to find enough resources to build
the project. If you are using a VM, you may want to allocate more cores or RAM
to the instance.

## Configuring Git

If you have not configured Git to use your name/email on your new Ubuntu setup,
you can use the script below to set up your Git configuration! It will help you
register your name and email with Git and authenticate so that you can push to
the repository.

```bash
$ ./scripts/store_git.sh
```

## Viewing simulation
Now that you've built the repository, check to make sure that the simulation works
on your computer. To do this, we will use a tool called `roslaunch`, which launches
up a simulation of our submarine.

For this, you will need multiple terminal windows! To create a new window in the
default terminal, use `Ctrl + Shift + t`.

In window one, write:

```bash
$ roslaunch sub8_launch gazebo.launch
```

In window two, write:

```bash
$ gazebogui
```

The first command launches the necessary subsystems for Gazebo, while the second command
launches the Gazebo GUI - aka, the thing you will actually interact with! If all
goes according to plan, you should see our robot in its own little world!

## Installing developer tools
After you have verified that your Git setup is working appopriately, take a look
at installing some developer tools on the [Developer Tools](/software/devtools)
page.

You are **highly recommended** to install `pre-commit`, but installing Zsh or
a specific editor is entirely up to you. If you choose not to install `pre-commit`,
the chance of your changes failing in CI is higher.

## What's next?
If the `catkin_make` didn't fail on your computer, you're all good to go!
Congratulations, and welcome to MIL!

The next step is to get assigned a task and to dive in. You should have the setup
to do so now!

:::{note}
In order to contribute code, you need to be in the [uf-mil GitHub organization](https://github.com/uf-mil).
First create a GitHub account if you do not have one, then ask someone in MIL / on Slack
to invite you.
