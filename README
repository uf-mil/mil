README for Arena SDK for Linux

The Arena SDK documentation includes a section called "Initial Configuration in Linux". Please review this section before proceeding.


Arena SDK requires the following dependencies:

- g++ 5 or higher
- make
- libx264-dev and libx265-dev if using the Save API

Installing Arena SDK for Linux:

1. Extract the tarball to your desired location:

    $ tar -xvzf ArenaSDK_Linux.tar.gz
    
    where ArenaSDK_Linux.tar.gz is the tarball name.

2. Run the Arena_SDK.conf file

    $ cd /path/to/ArenaSDK_Linux
    $ sudo sh Arena_SDK_Linux_x64.conf
    
    This will make the Arena SDK shared library files accessible by the run-time linker (ld.so or ld-linux.so).


Examples:
  
A precompiled version of the examples, including IpConfigUtility, are located in ArenaSDK_Linux/precompiledExamples.
    
- C++ examples are located in ArenaSDK_Linux/Examples/Arena. C examples are located in ArenaSDK_Linux/Examples/ArenaC. The Arena or ArenaC folders contain a Makefile that can be used to compile each example.

- Upon successful compilation, the compiled binaries will be placed into ArenaSDK_Linux/OutputDirectory/Linux/x64Release.
