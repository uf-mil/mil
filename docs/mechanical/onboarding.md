#### Join the Github organization
* In order to contribute to tasks, you need to create an account in **Github** and then email andrespulido@ufl.edu or someone you know to ask to join the [MIL Github](https://github.com/uf-mil/mil). In here, in the [Issues](https://github.com/uf-mil/mil/issues) tab you can [find a project to work on](/docs/mechanical/issues.md)
