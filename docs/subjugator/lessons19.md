# Lessons from RoboSub 2019

- **Hydrophones**
    - Before putting in water, rub dish soap over them. This will keep bubbles off.
    - Air bubbles/pockets/vessels are the biggest problem and will cause distortion
    Hydrophones should be placed as far away from air as is feasible and minimizing
    material that might contain air pockets (such as 3D printed parts) near the
    hydrophones is critical
- Molykote 44 medium should be used to cover all of the holes on the female connector
every time before inserting the connector.
- **We should have had a prep checklist.** - This should be mandatory for each time
the sub is put into the water. In RoboSub19 we forgot to close one of the air tubes
in the valve box so it flooded during a semifinal run.
- **We should design a method to perform effective surveying.** - Surveying consists
of estimating the distances and angles between objects underwater. In RoboSub 2019
the 3rd place team, Arizona State University, was able to navigate between tasks because
they used an exceptional surveying method and leveraged an optic gyroscopic system
to precisely rotate the sub.
