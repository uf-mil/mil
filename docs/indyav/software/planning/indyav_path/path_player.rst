Path Player
-----------

This is a utility that we use to play back a path that we recorded from earlier, so that we can test systems not related to path planning.

Path Player is just an instance of ``mil_tools TopicRecorder``. Its current behavior is that it will publish all messages in a bag file(our recorded path) in sequential order with correct timing between them. This utility is designed to be inherited from and the ``Play`` function overridden.

Basic Usage Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Complete the `Path Recorder Basic Usage Example First <path_recorder.html>`_.

- Launch `SubjuGator <../../../../subjugator/index.html>`_ in gazebo and clear the kill.

- In a new panel, play the previously recorded bag file.
  ``roslaunch indyav_launch path_player.launch``

- Visualize in Rviz by adding ``/path``.

- Witness the new red arrow trace the path of SubjuGator from earlier.
