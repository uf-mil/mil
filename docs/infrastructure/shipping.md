# Shipping

Eventually, our robots are going to need to be shipped to the competition locations.
To do this, we ship them, as they're way too big to carry on a plane!

## Packing List

The first step of shipping is making a packing list. This list includes everything
that we need to pack - missing even one item is annoying and costly, so having
an absolute list is helpful. We already have packing lists for both robots, but
these can be added to and removed from as needed.

As you pack, reference the list and check off items as you go so you don't wonder
why you can't find an item. The packing list will also be referenced when you
pack up at the competition site after the competition is over; it helps to ensure
you didn't miss anything accidentally.

## Shipping the Robot

To ship the robot, you will need to use a freight shipper, as the robot's box
is massive and heavy. Freight shipping is meant for items like this. Multiple
carriers offer freight shipping in the United States, but the university has some
deals with some of the carriers. Check with Dr. Schwartz about this.

## Shipping Materials

To ship materials, you can use ground shipping. We have multiple Pelican cases
for shipping materials, each of which is shipped separately.

## Batteries

One problematic item in shipping is a case of batteries. Due to their lithium
ion base, many shipping carriers won't take batteries without special precautions.
You will need to review these in order to ship them through standard shipping.
For some locations, it may be easier to buy batteries at the competition site
rather than to take batteries with you.
