# RoboSub competition

## Overview
The fundamental goal of the RoboSub competition is for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle
(AUV) to demonstrate its autonomy by completing underwater tasks, with a new theme each year.
The theme does not usually impact what the tasks themselves. There are usually tasks that
involve passing through a gate, recognizing images and shooting torpedoes at targets,
recognizing downfacing objects and dropping a marker, listening and localizing sound pingers
and navigate towards them, and surface in a specified area.

## Lessons Learned
