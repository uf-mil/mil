Simul8 is our internally implemented water vehicle dynamics and vision simulation. It is designed to support multiple vehicles at once, and always with one eye toward surface vessels. At least some part of this is to anticipate the possibility of both the RobotX WAM-V and some sub (probably not SubjuGator 8) interacting in the water.

# How to install
(You don't need to do any installation if you've run the install script)

    mkdir -p ~/repos
    cd ~/repos
    git clone https://github.com/vispy/vispy.git
    cd vispy
    git checkout b48e4d3cf410b853a74b666c475c603e46725e55
    sudo python setup.py develop

## Install ODE
If you have a weird ODE error on startup, this usually happens after updating Ubuntu. Here's a fix

    sudo apt-get install python-pyode
    rm -fr /tmp/pyode-build && mkdir -p /tmp/pyode-build && cd /tmp/pyode-build && sudo apt-get build-dep -y python-pyode && sudo apt-get remove -y python-pyode && apt-get source --compile python-pyode && sudo dpkg -i python-pyode_*.deb

Credit to Forrest for this - the Pyode on apt doesn't behave, but compiling from source works


# How do I run it?

Run...

    roslaunch subjugator_simulation sim_full.launch

Which will run all of the necessary nodes to run simulations.

# How does it work?
Simul8 has two major submodules: Physics and Rendering.

## Physics
The physics module is driven by pyODE (Python bindings to the Open Dynamics Engine). We define our own "World" object that manages all of the geometries and bodies that exist in the physics universe.

### Physics Entity
An entity is an object with physics. Currently implemented are Spheres, Boxes, and SubjuGator 8 approximated as a box. We will soon add arbitrary meshes.

Each entity implements a "step" method that is called for each physics step. They must also implement their own means for applying damping and buoyancy (Right now, everything uses a spherical submerged volume approximation, but you can implement your own)

## Rendering
The rendering module is driven by Vispy, powerful Python bindings to OpenGL. It also has a "world" concept, which manages all of the lighting, cameras, and objects for rendering.

### Rendering Entity
A rendering entity is an object to be drawn. It must have vertices, normals and faces defined. Each entity is drawn once for each view/imaging sensor. In the future, they may be drawn in multiple passes.

Each entity implements a "draw" method that is called each time it must be drawn.

An Entity can optionally implement texcoords for texturing.

Currently implemented are spheres, planes and boxes, and arbitrary input meshes.

Textures are not yet supported in .obj files due to a Vispy limitation. We are working on implementing a .obj reader that will include texture parameters.

# Bug-hunt

There are a few bugs in the simulator that should be chased down, but are not breaking.

* A light source has to be the last thing added - We know exactly why this is the case, but don't have a great structure for fixing it
