# What is SubjuGator?

SubjuGator is a fully Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) built by undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Florida. It is built to compete in the [RoboSub competition](http://www.robonation.org/competition/robosub), but it is used for much more. SubjuGator is an excellent research platform for students interested in creating autonomous systems. We research and implement all the necessary systems in areas such as controls, perception, motion planning, simulation, and more. While we aim to win, our main goal is to learn.
