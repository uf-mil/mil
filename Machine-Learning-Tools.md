Machine learning tools
===========

There are a few machine learning tools that exist for the sub.

Some of this may have been deprecated or otherwise changed. If you notice any discrepancies, point them out for bonus points!  

# Manual Segmentation

```shell
# in Sub8/gnc/sub8_perception/sub8_vision_tools/labelling
python ./manual_grabcut <path_to_bag> --topic <topic-to-segment> --output <pickle file name>

# For example,
python ./manual_grabcut ~/bag/2016-torpedo-bag.bag --topic /image/right --output segments.p
```

# Training an OpenCV Boost classifier on newly segmented data

```shell
# in Sub8/gnc/sub8_perception/sub8_vision_tools/machine_learning
python ./boost.py <pkl_file>

# For example,
python ./boost.py segments.p --output my-classifier.cv2
```


This will generate a python `pickle` file that contains a list of images and segmentations. It looks like this: [[image_1, segmentation_1], [image_2, segmentation_2],..., [image_N, segmentation_N]].


# Testing/Verifying the output

```shell
# In Sub8/gnc/sub8_perception/sub8_vision_tools/machine_learning

# For example
python verify_method.py ../data/start-gate.p ./start-gate-column-boost.cv2
```

# Glossary

* **.pkl** or **.p** - Python `pickle files, serialized Python objects
* **.cv2** - We choose the extension '.cv2' to refer to classifiers generated by OpenCV.
