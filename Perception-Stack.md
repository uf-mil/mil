Sub8 Perception
===============

Perception includes point cloud data from stereo and the imaging sonar as well as 2D-RGB data from the forward and down cameras.

The ultimate goal for Sub8 is to perform all tasks based on abstracted knowledge of what we're trying to do. 

We hope to estimate the location of tasks in advance, and then issue commands like "Go through the start gate" instead of

```
Find red lines
Move left or right until we are pointing between them
Go forward until 5 seconds after cannot see red lines
```
