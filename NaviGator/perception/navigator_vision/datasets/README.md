## Adding datasets

> Note: Datasets on labelbox are NONE-MUTABLE. Any new data must be added in a new dataset (the project can have any number of datasets).

1. Add the new bag files to project_bags.yaml under a new dataset. Follow the style and naming conventions established in that file.
1. Run `extract_bag_images.py` with project_bags.yaml to create a directory of images for the new dataset
1. Add this directory to /var/www/labelme/datasets/navigator-datasets on the CI server
1. Run the `labelbox_dataset_cloud.py` tool in `mil_common` with `https://ci.mil.ufl.edu/labelme/datasets/navigator-datasets/<your dataset>` for the URL. Pipe this into a new file `<my_dataset>.json`
1. Add the `<my_dataset>.json` dataset to labelbox.io
1. Add `<my_dataset>` to the `navigator_computer_vision` labelbox project
1. Commit the changes to project_bags.yaml and PR it
