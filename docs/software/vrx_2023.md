# VRX 2023

Thanks for your interest in working with the VRX tasks for 2023! We're happy to
have you participate in the competition!

There are some design changes for the competition this year that you need to be
aware of. First, VRX now defaults to supporting ROS 2, which is unfortunate for
us since we use ROS 1. But, don't be afraid! Thankfully, the VRX staff have built
a bridge between ROS 1 and ROS 2 that we can use to connect our submission with
their competition environment. This guide will help you get familiar with that
setup and how to work with VRX.

## Bridging VRX

## Launching Missions

To run the entire the entire VRX simulation, you can `roslaunch`. This launches
the example world (a basic setup).

```bash
roslaunch navigator_launch vrx.launch --screen
```

Some arguments you may want to provide include:

* `run_task` - This flag allows you to run and get scored for a certain task.
  An example argument includes `Navigation` (to run the navigation task). The
  task just runs the mission named `Vrx<your_argument>` (so in our case, it would
  run `VrxNavigation`).
