Purchasing
==========
Purchasing and shipping is integral to the proper and efficient functioning of our laboratory. Purchasing helps us to build complex projects, learn about new engineering techniques and tools, and most importantly, enjoy our time in MIL. However, if purchasing is not done correctly, annoying issues can arise! To prevent these, read below before making your first purchase.

Food and Beverage
-----------------
* **Beverage Vendors:** When buying beverages, you must buy **Pepsi** (including Gatorade and Aquafina, notably). You **cannot** buy other products, including Coke or Dr. Pepper products.
* **Meal Reimbursement Limits:** When buying meals, there are limits for reimbursements set by UF per meal. They are:
    * **Breakfast**: $6/person
    * **Lunch**: $12/person
    * **Dinner**: $19/person
* **Buying Pizza:** When purchasing pizza, please use coupons rather than paying full menu price for the pizzas.

Receipts for Reimbursements
---------------------------
When submitting receipts for reimbursements (for whatever), please ensure:

* You have **signed** the physical receipt with your name, UFID, and signature. You can do this electronically, if it's easier.
* You have submitted the receipt in a **timely** manner (ie, don't submit it six months after the purchase date).
* You provide the reason for the purchase, and if it is for food, who was in attendance at the event.

If you've met the above criteria, feel free to email your receipt to Dr. Schwartz! Please include an appropriate subject.
