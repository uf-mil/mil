# Enabling SubjuGator

Eventually, after working in simulations and theory for some amount of time,
you're going to want to go out to a real body of water to test the submarine!
That's perfect, this guide will help to walk you through some of the background
info needed to get moving.

## Power

SubjuGator 8 can be powered through two methods, AC power, and batteries. You're
going to want to use one over the other depending on where you're testing the
robot. If you're testing out of the water, you're going to want to use AC power,
as this will give you a nice, smooth uninterrupted power supply. If you're testing
in the water, then AC power is obviously no longer an option unless you want to
break the power supply. Therefore, you'll need to use batteries.

The AC power looks like a gray metal box, with a fan at two ends. It plugs into
a wall. You should then be able to use the power supply with the sub through a
connecting cable.

Otherwise, you can use two 24V LiPo batteries in the sub's battery compartment.
These batteries only last for a while, so use them sparingly, and don't try to
use them excessively. Misusing batteries will typically result in a fire or puffy
batteries.

The submarine automatically boots up whenever power is connected. There's no
on button!

## SSH

Now that the sub is on, you may to want to see what it's doing. That's where
the magical SSH comes in! You can run programs on the sub's computer, which is
helpful when you want to record bag files, run programs, see diagnostics, or
do anything else!
