    Represents an application-specific packet structure used by a CAN device. This
    class does not implement the entire packet that will be sent over the CAN bus;
    the packet only includes the identifier and payload in the packet.

    This class should be used to generate packets to send to the board. This packet
    does not handle communication with the board; this is instead handled by other
    packet classes.

    This class can be inherited from to implement packet structures for specific
