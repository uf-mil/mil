Keyboard Client: The keyboard client connects to the keyboard server in order
to control NaviGator using a remote keyboard. It is able to lock control of the
keyboard service to itself by obtaining a UUID that identifies it's service
calls. Curses is used to display a basic UI in the terminal that gives the user
useful feedback and captures key presses to be sent to the server.
