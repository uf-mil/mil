# Lessons from RoboSub19

- Hydrophones
    - Before putting in water, rub dish soap over them. This will keep bubbles off
    - Air bubbles/pockets/vessels are the biggest problem and will cause distortion
    Hydrophones should be placed as far away from air as is feasible and minimizing 
    material that might contain air pockets (such as 3D printed parts) near the 
    hydrophones is critical
- Molykote 44 medium should be used to cover all of the holes on the female connector 
every time before inserting the connector
- Prep checklist! - For each time sub goes in water. In RoboSub19 we forgot to close
one of the air tubes in the valve box so it flooded during a semifinal run
- Design a method to perform effective surveying. Surveying consists of estimating the 
distances and angles between objects underwater. In RoboSub19 the 3rd place, Arizona 
State University, was able to navigate between tasks because they used an exceptional 
surveying method and leveraged an optic gyroscopic system to precisely rotate the sub
