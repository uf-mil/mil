# Resources

Here is a list of the resources we recommend to getting started designing killer autonomous submarines and boats:

- **CAD**: Computer Aided Manufacturing is the software where we create 3D models of parts and assemblies. Here is the [webpage of Prof. Crane](http://www.ccrane3.com/eml2023/pages/videos.html), one of our advisors, where he teaches Solidworks, the CAD software we use. If you need help installing Solidworks talk to any mechanical member in the lab.
- **Design Resources**: The Design and Manufacturing Lab (DML) [website](https://mae.ufl.edu/designlab/) has a ton of resources. Feel free to navigate through the website and learn anything you find interesting. Recommended reads:
  -Design for Manufacturability, specifically DFM examples
  -The course video, to learn the common manufacturing process available in UF
  -Facility Safe  NOTE: a senior member of the lab **must** be present if you want to use machinery
  -Solidwork & Lab resources
