This is the beginning of the mil_msgs ros package. This is still in the process of being adapted from the legacy uf-common package. Be sure to update old references to uf_common if you find them around our repos.

This package should contain any .msg, .srv, or .action files that are platform agnostic and have potential to be used by multiiple robots.
