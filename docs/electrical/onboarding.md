# Electrical Onboarding

Welcome to the electrical team here at MIL! Our team is responsible for much of the
team's electrical systems on the robots. This requires developing special hardware, circuitry,
and embedded systems.

## Join the electrical Slack channel
Like the other teams, we use Slack as our primary communication platform. Our
Slack workspace can be found at [https://uf-mil.slack.com](https://uf-mil.slack.com/).
Ask someone in MIL to invite you or email [ems@ufl.edu](mailto:ems@ufl.edu).

Once youâ€™re on Slack, be sure to join the [#electrical](https://app.slack.com/client/T6VBSPR50/C6VGAF2MA)
channel. This is where we will post important updates about the electrical team,
including meeting times.

## Join the electrical GitHub
Unlike the software and mechanical teams (who share a GitHub repository), we use
a separate repository for the electrical team. As a result, you will need to be added
to this organization. Once you're in Slack (or you've come to the lab), ask an electrical
leader to add you to the GitHub organization. The organization can be found [here](https://github.com/uf-mil-electrical).

We use several different repositories to store information. Typically one repo is used
to hold information about one specific electrical design.

## Complete the Getting Started Tutorial
Now, complete the Getting Started Tutorial found on our GitHub [here](https://github.com/uf-mil-electrical/Getting-Started).
This tutorial will walk you through gaining the skills you need to become a complete
electrical wizard!

If you need help with any part of the tutorial, please contact an electrical lead.
