# Control
Software that relates to generating vehicle actuation commands should go here. Possible that path planning will go here if the algorithm is tightly coupled with the control algorithm.

## Packages
Information about current included software will go here.

## Discussion
Initial development will start simple.

### Pure Pursuit Steering Control
Initial implementations for the path tracking controller will be a pure pursuit controller

### PID Speed Control
The speed control will consist of some combination of proportional, integral, and derivative. The error state will be the delta between a desired and measured forward speed.

## Future Work
* MPC controller will probably be looked into.
