Teledyne BlueView Software Development Kit License Agreement
This Software Development Kit License Agreement (this “Agreement”) is made by and between Teledyne BlueView, Inc. (“Teledyne”) having a facility at 18702 North Creek Parkway, Ste. 100, Bothell, WA 98011 and the recipient of this Agreement (“Recipient” or “You”). In consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth, the parties hereby agree as follows:
By installing, accessing or otherwise using the SDK, You accept the terms of this Agreement. If You do not agree to the terms of this agreement, do not install, access or use the SDK or the APIs.  If You are using this for the benefit of Your employer or other entity or You are agreeing to be bound by this Agreement on behalf of Your employer or other entity, You represent and warrant that You have full legal authority to bind Your employer or such entity to this Agreement. If You do not have the requisite authority, You may not accept the Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of Your employer or other entity.  You may not use the SDK and may not accept this Agreement if You or your employer is a person or entity barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries including the country in which You are resident or from which You use the SDK.

1.	Scope.  The SDK is made available by Teledyne to assist developers in integrating certain functionality of the Software and other Teledyne services into software, products, and services.  Teledyne is willing to supply the Software Development Kit and any associated documentation, software code or other materials made available by Teledyne, including without limitation documentation for certain application programming interfaces (“APIs”) (collectively “SDK”) to You solely to assist You with integrating the Teledyne Sonar Products or certain of its features and functionality (“Software”) into Your software or systems. This Agreement applies to any updates, supplements or support services for the SDK, unless other terms accompany those items.
2. 	SDK License.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Teledyne grants You a limited, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the SDK solely to develop software and applications to run or integrate with the Software.  You agree that Teledyne or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to the SDK and the Software, including any Intellectual Property Rights that exist in the SDK and Software. "Intellectual Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights.  Teledyne reserves all rights not expressly granted to You.  Except as expressly permitted herein, You may not modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK or copies thereof.  You may copy the SDK, provided that You reproduce only complete copies, including without limitation all “read me” files, copyright notices, and other legal notices and terms that are included in the SDK.  Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open source software license, if any, are governed solely by the terms of that open source software license and not this Agreement.  You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Teledyne provides may change without prior notice to You and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Teledyne may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to You or to users generally at Teledyne 's sole discretion, without prior notice to You.  Nothing in this Agreement gives You a right to use any of Teledyne's trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.  You agree that You will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the SDK.
3.	License to Distribute Redistributables. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Teledyne grants you a limited, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to reproduce and distribute the binary form of those files specifically identified as redistributable in the SDK "README" file ("Redistributables") provided that: (i) you distribute the Redistributables complete and unmodified (unless otherwise specified in the applicable README file), and only bundled as part of Your software, products and services, (ii) you do not distribute additional software intended to supersede any component(s) of the Redistributables, (iii) you do not remove or alter any proprietary legends or notices contained in or on the Redistributables, (iv) you only distribute the Redistributables pursuant to a license agreement that protects Teledyne s interests consistent with the terms contained in the Agreement, (v) you agree to defend and indemnify Teledyne and its licensors from and against any damages, costs, liabilities, settlement amounts and/or expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with any claim, lawsuit or action by any third party that arises or results from the use or distribution of any and all of Your software, products and services, and (vi) include the following statement as part of product documentation (whether hard copy or electronic), as a part of a copyright page or proprietary rights notice page, in an "About" box or in any other form reasonably designed to make the statement visible to users of the Software:
4. 	Use of the SDK.  Teledyne agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from You (or Your licensors) under this Agreement in or to any software applications or systems or products that You develop or integrate with using the SDK, including any intellectual property rights which exist in those applications.  You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by (a) this Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions.  You agree that if You use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, You will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users.  If Your application stores personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely.  You agree that You are solely responsible for (and that Teledyne has no responsibility to You or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that You create, transmit or display as a result of Your use of the SDK.
5.	Fees.  Teledyne charges a one time purchase fee for the SDK. Beyond this, no payments shall be owed by either party to the other for the license and rights granted herein.  Each party shall be responsible for any applicable taxes, fees, or expenses incurred by such party pursuant to this Agreement.  Each party will retain any other revenue generated in connection with this Agreement or any software developed therefrom.  Teledyne reserves the right in the future to charge for use of the SDK or the APIs. If Teledyne chooses to establish fees and payment terms for such use, Teledyne will notify You of such terms and You may elect to stop using the SDK and/or APIs rather than incurring fees.
6.	Support.  Teledyne is not obligated to provide any technical or other support (“Support Services”) for the SDK to You.  If Teledyne chooses to offer any Support Services to You, Your use of such Support Services will be governed by then-current Teledyne policies. With respect to any technical or other information You provide to Teledyne in connection with the Support Services, You agree that Teledyne has an unrestricted right to use such information for its business purposes, including for product support and development. Teledyne will not use such information in a form that personally identifies You.
7. 	Terminating this Agreement.  This Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either You or Teledyne as set out below. If You want to terminate this Agreement, You may do so by ceasing Your use of the SDK.  Teledyne may, at any time, terminate this Agreement with You if: (A) You have breached any provision of this Agreement; or (B) Teledyne is required to do so by law; or (C) any partner or licensor with whom Teledyne offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to You has terminated its relationship with Teledyne or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to You; or (D) Teledyne decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the country in which You are resident; or (E) the provision of the SDK or certain SDK services to You by Teledyne is, in Teledyne's sole discretion, no longer commercially viable.  When this Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and liabilities that You and Teledyne have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued over time while this Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation.
8. 	DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.  YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM TELEDYNE.

YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT TELEDYNE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT TELEDYNE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
10. 	Indemnification.  To the maximum extent permitted by law, You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Teledyne, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) Your use of the SDK, (b) any application, function, or system You develop using or based on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) Your non-compliance with this Agreement.
11. 	Changes to this Agreement.  Teledyne may make changes to this Agreement as it distributes new versions of the SDK.

You agree that Your use of a specific version of the SDK is governed by the Agreement included with that version of the SDK.
12. 	General.
12.1 	Entire Agreement.  This Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between You and Teledyne with respect to the SDK and governs Your use of the SDK (excluding any consulting services related to the SDK which Teledyne may provide to You under a separate written agreement), and completely replaces and supersedes any prior agreements between You and Teledyne in relation to the SDK.
12.2 	No Waiver.  You agree that if Teledyne does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in this Agreement (or which Teledyne has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Teledyne's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Teledyne.
12.3 	Severability.  If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of this Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from this Agreement without affecting the rest of this Agreement. The remaining provisions of this Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
12.4 	Third Party Beneficiaries.  You acknowledge and agree that each member of any group of companies of which Teledyne is affiliated shall be third party beneficiaries to this Agreement and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of this Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them.  Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to this Agreement.

Neither You nor Teledyne shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party, provided, however, that Teledyne may assign or transfer this Agreement to any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Teledyne or any entity that acquires or succeeds to all or substantially all of Teledyne’s assets or stock.
12.7 	Choice of Law.  This Agreement, and Your relationship with Teledyne under this Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Washington without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Teledyne agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within King County, Washington to resolve any legal matter arising from this Agreement.  Notwithstanding this section, You agree that Teledyne may still apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.
