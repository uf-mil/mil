# Onboarding
If you have reached this page, you likely want to get started working in MIL.
We're quite excited to have you on the team! Here's to a grand future
of learning and late nights coding. This guide explains the steps
to take to get started as a developer.
## Watch the intro video
Watch the [virtual tour](https://tinyurl.com/mil-kickoff-f20) that we recorded in September 2020!

## Learn abour our Culture
MIL does things differently than many other labs or student organizations.
Before you get started, read about our [culture](/docs/culture).

## Join Slack and say hello
We use Slack as our primary communication platform. Our slack is [uf-mil.slack.com](https://uf-mil.slack.com). Ask someone in MIL to invite you or email kmallen@ufl.edu.
Once you're on slack, be sure to join the [#software](https://uf-mil.slack.com/messages/C6UQUU78Q) channel and introduce yourself.

## Join the Github organization
In order to contribute code, you need to be in the [uf-mil Github organization](https://github.com/uf-mil). First create an acount if you do not have one, then ask someone in MIL / on slack to invite you.

## Install the repsitory
To get started running the code we use for our robots, see the [Getting Started Guide](/docs/development/getting_started) to clone the repo correctly, then the [Contributing Guide](/docs/development/contributing) to get started with making changes to the repo!

## Research our highly used libraries and tools
It is recommended that before you start on a project you gain a basic understanding of [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) through the excellent [tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials). If you are new to programming (non CS student), there are two free courses about Python for Robotics and Linux for Robotics offered by [The Construct](https://www.theconstructsim.com/intro-to-robot-programming-ros-learning-path/). If you know other progamming languages but not python, this [Course](https://dabeaz-course.github.io/practical-python/Notes/01_Introduction/01_Python.html) might help. 

Some other things you will benifit from learning:

* C++
* Python
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [PCL](http://pointclouds.org/)

## Select and start on a project
Now that you have your development machine setup and have a basic understanding of our dependencies, it's time to start working on something!

See the [Github projects page](https://github.com/uf-mil/mil/projects), select a project, and check its "To do" column to see the work that is currently needed.
Once you found something you're interested in (or come up with something else), let people know in slack so you can be officialy assigned to the issue.
