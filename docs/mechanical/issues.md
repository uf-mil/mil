# Issues
 

## Getting started on a project
After you join the [MIL Github](https://github.com/uf-mil/mil), go to the issues tab, where all the unresolved projects or To-Dos are organized with their description. You can filter the mechanical issues using labels. If you are freshmen or transfer without much experience we recommend starting with the issues that are also labeled ["good first issue"](https://github.com/uf-mil/mil/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) well as checking our recommended [Resources](resources) to gain the skills necessary to start designing. After you select a project that you want to work on, you can assign yourself to that issue on the right. This way the more senior members can know you will start working on it. If you have any questions you can always message the creator of the issue on Slack. Good luck!
