:mod:`mil_missions` - Mission System
------------------------------------

The mission system is used to run "missions", or client modules used to orchestrate
the desired end behavior of the robot. Missions are commonly implemented to orchestrate
the behavior of a robot in preparation for a competition. Usually, mission code
will not be used in other parts of the repository; rather, other modules are used
by mission code.
